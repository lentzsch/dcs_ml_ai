# DCS ML AI

An experimental project using reinforcement learning to train an AI pilot for Digital Combat Simulator (DCS).

## Goals

- Develop a high-difficulty, human-like fighter pilot AI using modern RL methods.
- Implement multiple difficulty levels using error modeling and personality traits.
- Explore use of Tacview and supervised imitation learning for realism.

## Stack

- Python 3.11
- `gymnasium`
- `stable-baselines3`
- `torch`
- Custom training environment

## Status

ðŸš§ In early development. Currently setting up environment and tooling.
