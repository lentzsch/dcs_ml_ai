## A.V.A. Dev Log â€“ 2025-07-31

**Summary of Accomplishments:**
Today marked a major milestone in the development of A.V.A. (Autonomous Virtual Ace). We successfully designed, built, and validated a 2D energy-based flight environment that models realistic pitch/thrust behavior for training reinforcement learning agents. Visual rendering and infrastructure for future TacView integration were also implemented.

### ðŸ§± Environment Design
- **Custom Gymnasium Environment** simulating fixed-wing aircraft flight in 2D profile
- **Action Space**:
  - Elevator deflection (`-1` to `1`)
  - Throttle setting (`0` to `1`)
- **Observation Space**:
  - `[pitch, pitch_rate, altitude, vertical_speed, airspeed, fuel, throttle, elevator]`
- **Physics Engine Highlights**:
  - Throttle adds total energy (thrust)
  - Pitch exchanges energy between kinetic (airspeed) and potential (altitude)
  - Drag is modeled as a quadratic function of airspeed
  - Fuel usage tied to throttle application
- **Reward Function**:
  - Penalizes deviation from a target airspeed (e.g., 120 knots)
  - Penalizes inefficient fuel usage
  - Rewards trimmed, efficient energy management

### ðŸŽ® Visual Feedback
- `render()` method implemented using **matplotlib**
  - Displays real-time position and pitch angle
  - Includes overlays for airspeed, altitude, and fuel
  - Supports motion trails for trajectory visualization
- Output compatible with **`RecordVideo`** to generate training videos

### ðŸ§ª Logging and Checkpointing
- **TensorBoardCallback** for real-time training metric visualization
- **EvalCallback** to save best model on reward improvement
- **CheckpointCallback** for regular autosaves every N steps
- Log structure aligned with Stable-Baselines3 best practices

### ðŸ“¡ TacView Integration Prep
- Created placeholder for `telemetry_logger.py`
  - Structure in place for `.csv` or future `.acmi` export
  - Logs key state data per timestep (pitch, altitude, speed, fuel, etc.)

### ðŸ§  Design Decisions and Rationale
- **Energy Management Focus**:
  - Chose to simulate real pilot behavior over simplified game physics
  - Reflected real-world principle: *pitch controls airspeed, power controls altitude*
- **Matplotlib Visualization**:
  - Chosen for speed, simplicity, and familiarity
  - Easier to interpret for early training behaviors than raw TensorBoard data
- **Reward Shaping**:
  - Structured to reinforce fuel-efficient, stable flight rather than just speed
  - Prepares A.V.A. for long-term goals like combat maneuvering and mission endurance

### âœ… Project Status
- Environment complete and validated
- Logging and checkpointing active
- Visualization functional and producing video output
- TacView export queued for future
- Training to begin next session

### ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Begin training runs with PPO
- Review saved episodes and TensorBoard trends
- Refine reward function and hyperparameters based on early behavior
- Expand curriculum toward maneuvering, intercepts, and combat readiness
